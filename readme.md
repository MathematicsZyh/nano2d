A simple game engine--just 4.69KB
---------------------------------
The game engine is not very good,since it was developed totally by a junior high school student(me).    
I will be very thankful for you to improve it.    
You can get the codes and use the engine in your own game.Please mark that you use the engine.Like Unity.      
Sorry for not writing a guide.You have to learn it form the codes itself.Very sorry for that.
